# Reputation-Based Decentralized Identity Credit Scoring System

## Overview
A sophisticated decentralized identity (DID) system built on the Stacks blockchain that provides a comprehensive credit scoring mechanism based on on-chain activities, transaction patterns, and verified reputation. The system implements privacy-preserving features while maintaining transparency and trust in credit assessment.

## Core Features

### Identity Management
- Decentralized user identity creation and management
- Multi-level verification system
- Privacy controls with selective disclosure
- Customizable privacy levels (Public, Limited, Private)

### Credit Scoring
- Dynamic score calculation based on multiple factors:
  - Transaction success ratio
  - Volume-weighted scoring
  - Activity recency
  - Transaction frequency
- Score range: 300-850 (industry standard)
- Automatic score adjustments based on on-chain behavior

### Business Integration
- Tiered access system for businesses
- Verification process for business entities
- Customizable data access levels
- Secure API endpoints for integration

### Privacy Features
- Three-tier privacy system
  - Public: Basic score visibility
  - Limited: Partial data access
  - Private: Full access control
- Selective disclosure mechanisms
- Business authorization controls

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Components

#### Core Maps
```clarity
UserScores Map:
- credit-score: uint
- last-updated: uint
- transaction-count: uint
- verification-status: bool
- privacy-level: uint

UserTransactions Map:
- successful-txs: uint
- failed-txs: uint
- total-volume: uint
- avg-transaction-size: uint
- last-transaction-time: uint

AuthorizedBusinesses Map:
- access-level: uint
- verification-status: bool
```

#### Key Functions

##### User Management
```clarity
(define-public (initialize-user (privacy-level uint))
(define-public (update-privacy-level (new-level uint))
(define-public (update-transaction-history (success bool) (volume uint))
```

##### Business Integration
```clarity
(define-public (register-business (access-level uint))
(define-public (verify-business (business principal))
```

##### Score Calculation
```clarity
(define-private (calculate-transaction-score (user-stats {...}))
(define-private (update-credit-score (user principal) (transaction-score uint))
```

### Security Measures
- Owner-only administrative functions
- Privacy-aware data access controls
- Input validation and error handling
- Secure score calculation mechanisms
